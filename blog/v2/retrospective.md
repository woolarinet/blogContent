description1: Over the last 4 years, I’ve advanced my career in a way that differs from most engineers. I began by developing my own service and worked at several startups in Korea and Indonesia.
But deep down, I wasn't satisfied. I had always had a strong desire to improve my English and work in North America. I wanted to achieve it on my own, from scratch.
So I decided to give it a shot, and whenever I told people about my decision, they said it wouldn’t work. They told me, "You’ll be competing with people from all over the world. How can you succeed?"
I definitely expected it to be a somewhat rough patch, but I believed I would get through it eventually if I kept pushing myself consistently.
So, I quit everything and moved to Vancouver without any plans.
It was as tough as I expected. I had no network, and I had to prove myself solely with my skills. On top of that, the job market was really terrible, and the competition was fierce.
I had to push myself to keep going, trying everything I could. I attended every development seminar, made my own business cards and visited IT companies to hand them out, all the while studying English and development skills every single day.
After 2 months, I finally found a great company, and now I’m working with them.
I was really lucky. It wasn’t because I was exceptional, but just because I stayed consistent, and when the opportunity came, I was just ready to grab it. And the same can happen for anyone.
description2: Fear is a mile wide, and an inch deep. And so it looks like the ocean, that you are gonna step into and drown. But as soon as you step into it, you realize it was not that deep at all and you can keep walking through it.

To everyone reading this, I want to say

If someone like me can do it, you can too. We all have potential, and your potential might be even greater than mine. Don’t give up. If you keep going, good opportunities will come, and that opportunity will be yours.
